Notes for me.. Things I do when I release

1. Make sure ChangeLog mentions notable changes.  
2. Make sure version string is at the top of the ChangeLog.
3. Make sure pbp/version.py has the correct version tuple.
4. See if README needs to have any language changed.
5. update doc/pbp.html including several version strings and download uri
6. (tests)
7. svn up from the root and commit or revert all changes
8. Copy the blessed revision to a tag
9. svn co (don't use switch!!) the tag (on windows and unix)
10. build release files on Windows: $ aap 
11. build release files on Unix: $ python setup.py sdist
12. upload pbp-*-setup.exe, pbp-*.zip and pbp-*.tar.gz to berlios
13. do the file release dance on berlios (hey, make a pbp script for this :)
