      title: Making Progress on Next Release
      c: >
        Oh point four is coming soon.  I've done the hard part, which is
        the http auth stuff.  The other major thing remaining is comparison
        testing for the current form values.  Check the [roadmap page
        http://openfacts.berlios.de/index-en.phtml?title=PBP_TODO] for
        progress.

      title: Minor Project Name Change
      c: >
        PBP now stands for "Python Browser Poseur" instead of "Python Browsing
        Probe." I was getting a lot of porn referrals with the other name.
        Don't ask.  Links to everything but the first page of the Wiki will
        still work; for that one link, use the Wiki link on this page as your
        new bookmark.

      title: '0.3.0 Important Feature Release'
      c: >
        Major changes are: a command to let testers set the user-agent string
        and impersonate a different browser, an 'echo' command for writing
        text into the output, well-behaved shell exit status (>0 if there's a
        script error), and bugs fixed.

      title: '0.2.2 Minor Feature Update Release'
      c: >
        Fixed an important bug in the submit command, and added support for
        the buildbot (see [the Buildbot site http://buildbot.sf.net] and
        README.buildbot in Buildbot directory).
         
        In addition, this release bundles mechanize and its components into
        the distribution package! The tarball and zip file both contain
        these components, while the setup.exe has always contained them.
        This makes installing it from source easier.

      title: '0.2.1 Bugfix Release'
      c: >
        This release fixes various places where the threaded implementation
        would refuse to quit on Unix platforms; scripts will now exit properly
        there.
