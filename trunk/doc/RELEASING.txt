Notes for me.. Things I do when I release

1. Make sure ChangeLog mentions notable changes.  
2. Make sure version string is at the top of the ChangeLog.
3. Make sure pbp/version.py has the correct version tuple.
4. See if README needs to have any language changed.
5. Update doc/news.yml - add a news item and change value of release
6. Update doc/pbp.html by running news2yaml news.yml > pbp.html
7. (tests)
8. svn up from the root and commit or revert all changes
9. Copy the blessed revision to a tag
10. svn co the tag (on windows and unix) - don't use switch, it doesn't update
    properties properly
11. build release files on Windows: $ aap 
12. build release files on Unix: $ python setup.py sdist
13. upload pbp-*-setup.exe, pbp-*.zip and pbp-*.tar.gz to berlios
14. do the file release dance on berlios (hey, make a pbp script for this :)
15. update Wiki same as #5
16. upload pbp.html to http://pbp.berlios.de
17. news item on berlios project
18. notify freshmeat.net
19. notify pbp mailing list
