	(unversioned yet) User-visible changes:
	---------------------
	* Don't blow up when a submit takes you to a location with an error code.
	* Put wwwsearch.zip first in sys.path so conflicting versions installed on
	  the system already won't cause problems.
	* http auth urls are supported.
	* <meta refresh> tags that contain only a time and no url are
	  parsed correctly instead of raising an exception.
	* Buildbot: pbpstep.py runs only one .tests file, named on the command
	  line.  This should be less surprising, and it gives more control (i.e.
	  you can get separate boxes for different, unrelated tests in the
	  builder.)
	* --version prints something relevant.
	* Name change "Python Browsing Probe" -> "Python Browser Poseur"
	* New command: showlinks--print a nicely formatted list of the links on
	  the page 
	* New command: url--show or test the current URL
	* New command: title--show or test the current <title>
	* New command: reload--request a reload of the current page
	* Fixed a minor formatting problem in showform

PBP (0.3.0)
	User-visible changes:
	---------------------
	* 'agent' command lets testers set the user-agent string so PBP
	  can impersonate a different browser.
	* In batch mode, exit status >0 if at least one script does not succeed.
	  This makes things like pbpscript in Makefiles work better.
	* 'echo' command, for writing messages into the log file
	* Strings that begin with literal $ but are not defined variables will 
	  be echoed literally instead of raising an AttributeError
	* Inputs with no name (such as submit buttons) do not cause 
	  showform to break. Closes #1968 (thanks to Doug Winter's patch) 

PBP (0.2.2)
	User-visible changes:
	---------------------
	* The [stopat] argument of the submit command is used, not ignored.
	* ``fv'' is a synonym for ``formvalue''
	* added buildbot directory with stuff for master and slave side
	  of a buildbot.  See README.buildbot.

PBP (0.2.1) 
	User-visible changes: 
	--------------------- 
	* Unix will no longer hang when a script is done. (Closes bug 001903)

PBP (0.2.0)
	User-visible changes:
	---------------------
	* pyload/do.  You can pyload a python file that defines __pbp__, and names
	  in __pbp__ will be visible in the pbp interpreter using the do command
	  or by referencing them as strings with $name.
	* Timeout command now works.  It times out the entire browser
	  session; so in a command like this:
	  $ pbpscript script1.pbp script2.pbp script3.pbp
	  A timeout specified in script1 can expire during the execution
	  of script2, causing both script2 and script3 to fail immediately.
	* EOF is a synonym for quit/done.
	Developer-visible changes:
	--------------------------
	* Substantial refactoring.  In batch mode, PBP now uses a thread
	  for each script (they still share the same browser session and
	  run in serial).
	* Exception classses moved into their own module. 

PBP (0.1.0)
	* Initial release.
