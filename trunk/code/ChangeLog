	User-visible changes:
	* echo command, for writing messages into the log file
	* Strings that contain literal $ but are not defined variables will 
	  be echoed literally instead of raising an AttributeError
	* 
PBP (0.2.2)
	User-visible changes:
	---------------------
	* The [stopat] argument of the submit command is used, not ignored.
	* ``fv'' is a synonym for ``formvalue''
	* added buildbot directory with stuff for master and slave side
	  of a buildbot.  See README.buildbot.
PBP (0.2.1) 
	User-visible changes: 
	--------------------- 
	* Unix will no longer hang when a script is done. (Closes bug 001903)
PBP (0.2.0)
	User-visible changes:
	---------------------
	* pyload/do.  You can pyload a python file that defines __pbp__, and names
	  in __pbp__ will be visible in the pbp interpreter using the do command
	  or by referencing them as strings with $name.
	* Timeout command now works.  It times out the entire browser
	  session; so in a command like this:
	  $ pbpscript script1.pbp script2.pbp script3.pbp
	  A timeout specified in script1 can expire during the execution
	  of script2, causing both script2 and script3 to fail immediately.
	* EOF is a synonym for quit/done.
	Developer-visible changes:
	--------------------------
	* Substantial refactoring.  In batch mode, PBP now uses a thread
	  for each script (they still share the same browser session and
	  run in serial).
	* Exception classses moved into their own module. 
PBP (0.1.0)
	* Initial release.
