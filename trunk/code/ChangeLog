PBP (0.2.0)
    User-visible changes:
    ---------------------
    * Timeout command now works.  It times out the entire browser
      session; so in a command like this:
      $ pbpscript script1.pbp script2.pbp script3.pbp
      A timeout specified in script1 can expire during the execution
      of script2, causing both script2 and script3 to fail immediately.
    * EOF is a synonym for quit/done.
    Developer-visible changes:
    --------------------------
    * Substantial refactoring.  In batch mode, PBP now uses a thread
      for each script (they still share the same browser session and
      run in serial).
    * Exception classses moved into their own module. 
PBP (0.1.0)
    * Initial release.
